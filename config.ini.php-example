;
; The order that you put these blocks in determine in what order they will be listed in the menu.
; Enable or disable each block and edit the URL to point to your desired location.
;
; Please note that if Muximux is served via HTTPS, any services that are NOT served via HTTPS might be blocked by your web-browser.
; Loading of unsecured content in the context of an SSL encrypted website where you see a green lock would be misleading, therefore the browser blocks it.
; One work-around is to serve Muximux via an unsecured website, or to make sure all the services/urls you link to use https://
;
; Alternatively, if you use Chrome or Opera (or any Chromium-based browser), you can install the plugin "Ignore X-Frame headers", which
; drops X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy HTTP response headers, allowing ALL pages to be iframed (like we're doing in Muximux).
;
; See: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe
;
;
;
; You must rename this file to config.ini.php for Muximux to function.
;
; See https://github.com/causefx/ or https://github.com/mescon/Muximux/ for more information.

; You can copy and edit these blocks any way you'd like.
; Just add a NEW block with your desired info if you want another item in Muximux!
